# Roman-Clicker
Roman Clicker, made for jokes

## Current goal:
Completely recreate the game from the ground up, that means to keep its original idea as much as possible while improving/changing things

# Future of the project
From time to time the game will get content and QoL updates, but the changelog and game will only be on itch.io, the source-code will keep being updated tho<br>
The itch.io page is ready! https://cnnn666v2.itch.io/roman-clicker
